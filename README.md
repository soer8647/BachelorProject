To run the WOTS parameter experiment, run:  Test/Crypto/WotsParameterExperiment.java

topParam can be changed to determine the highest packing factor tested.

iterations determines how many times the test is run.


To run the WOTS vs RSA experiment, run:   Test/Crypto/CryptoExperiment.java

packing factor, iterations and rsa parameters can be changed.
